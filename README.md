# Contact App

A simple web contact app you can use to list all of the contacts you added, and edit them.

## Specifications:

* This app has been created on Ruby 3.1.3, and Rails 7.0.4.2. Also I have used Bootstrap v5.3 to style it.

* This app have not been hosted in a web server yet. When it does, you can use it on the latest version of Chrome.

* For now, you can test it on your localhost if you have Ruby 3.1.3, and Rails 7.0.4.2. Just download the files and enter "rails s" command on your terminal.
